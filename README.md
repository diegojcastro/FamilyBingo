# FamilyBingo
First attempt at an android game. Built on Android Studio, written in Kotlin.

Available in Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsbydiego.familybingo

Inspired by the TV show Life In Pieces (season 2, episode 10). When family brunches are dull, a few members secretly make "bingo" cards with text entries on each box. Each entry describes a common catchphrase or occurrence to these gatherings.
Players mark off each entry as they see it happen. First one to complete five in a row wins.

An amusing idea, now available as an Android app. Set up a board, fill out every entry. When you're done setting up, press the button to play. Check each box as marked or missed. First to complete five in a row wins, or compete for the highest score in the end by checking as many boxes as possible.
Don't just use it for family gatherings! Great for movie nights (Hallmark Christmas movies are particularly good), TV show predictions, competitive sports, and more.
